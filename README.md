# Pandora's Box

Pandora's Box is a set of experimental animated Svelte UI components that I made for my site.

## How to use

1.  Set up your svelte project if you haven't already
2.  Install (Dependancies)\[#Dependancies\] if you haven't already
3.  Copy / Paste your desired components somewhere in your project where you can easily access them. Eg. lib/components
4.  Customise. By default the color scheme is Slate. Change it to by the scheme you use.
5.  Use & Enjoy

## Dependancies

- Tailwind
- Svelte (obviously)
- Svelte/transition
- Lucide/Svelte\*

\\\* Lucide Svelte is only necessary if you don't have an icon pack installed. If you to, update all the components you take from here with your icon pack of choice.
